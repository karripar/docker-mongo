# Docker mongo app assignment. Creating a docker container with a pre-existing mongoose application.

### Initial process

- I copied the mongoose node app developed in the palvelinohjelmointi course.
- I installed required packages with `npm i`
- Ran `docker init`
- Chose what port to use (3000), project type (node) and generated the compose.yaml file, Dockerfile and readme files.
- After configuring the compose files I tested the container by running `docker compose up --watch`
